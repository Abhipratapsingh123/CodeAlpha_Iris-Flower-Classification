# CodeAlpha Iris Classification

This project was developed during my data science internship at **CodeAlpha**.  
It focuses on predicting the species of an iris flower based on its morphological characteristics (length/width of petals and sepals), using supervised classification models.

---

##  Project Objective
- Understand and apply supervised classification concepts.  
- Build a model capable of predicting the species of a flower (**Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica**).  
- Explore visual differences between the species.  

---

## Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python 3**  
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation  
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib** – Data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning models (KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, etc.)  

---

##  Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle - Iris Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris)  
- **Size:** 150 samples, 4 features  
- **Features:**
  - SepalLengthCm  
  - SepalWidthCm  
  - PetalLengthCm  
  - PetalWidthCm  
- **Target:** `Species` (3 classes: Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

##  Project Workflow

### 1. Data Loading & Exploration
- Statistical analysis and missing value check  
- Data visualization with Seaborn  

### 2. Data Preparation
- Split features (independent variables) and target (dependent variable)  
- Train-test split  

### 3. Modeling
Trained and compared multiple supervised models:
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
- **Decision Tree**  
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  

### 4. Evaluation
- Confusion Matrix  
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall  
- Cross-validation (optional)  

---

##  Results
- Compared the performance of different classifiers  
- Identified the most effective model for predicting iris species
